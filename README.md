RGB Pendant
===========

These are the source files (schematic and code) for a color-changing trinket, originally designed to be used as a necklace pendant.
The design is based off an ATtiny85 and a generic common-cathode RGB LED.

The boards have been done in EAGLE 7.1.0 Light and KiCad (2013-07-07BZR 4022)-stable and as of this commit have not yet been tested for manufacture, but they have no design-rule errors.
To compile the code with the Arduino IDE, you need the following:
* ATtiny cores: https://code.google.com/p/arduino-tiny/
* WinAVR Linker bugfix: http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php/topic,116674.0.html
